Dataquest ANSWER:
opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
from csv import reader
read_file = reader(opened_file)
apps_data = list(read_file)
ratings = []
for row in apps_data[1:]:
    rating = float(row[7])
    price = float(row[4])
    
    if price > 9:
        ratings.append(rating)
        
avg_rating = sum(ratings) / len(ratings)
n_apps_more_9 = len(ratings)
n_apps_less_9 = len(apps_data[1:]) - len(ratings)

My ANSWER:
opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
from csv import reader
read_file = reader(opened_file)
apps_data = list(read_file)

price_apps_more_9 = []
ratings_apps_more_9 = []
for row in apps_data[1:]:
    price = float(row[4])
    rating = float(row[7])
    if price > 9 and rating >= 0:
        price_apps_more_9.append(price)
        ratings_apps_more_9.append(rating)
                
avg_rating = sum(ratings_apps_more_9)/len(ratings_apps_more_9)
        
n_apps_more_9 = (len(price_apps_more_9))
        
        
price_apps_less_9 = []

for row in apps_data[1:]:
    price = float(row[4])
    rating = float(row[7])
    if price <= 9:
        price_apps_less_9.append(price)
n_apps_less_9 = (len(price_apps_less_9))
