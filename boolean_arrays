# Boolean Indexing With NumPy
# 8.Assignment Using Boolean Arrays Continued
# We have created a new copy of our taxi dataset, taxi_modified with an additional column containing the value 0 for every row.
# In our new column at index 15, assign the value 1 if the pickup_location_code (column index 5) corresponds to an airport location, 
# leaving the value as 0 otherwise by performing these three operations:
#   For rows where the value for the column index 5 is equal to 2 (JFK Airport), assign the value 1 to column index 15.
#   For rows where the value for the column index 5 is equal to 3 (LaGuardia Airport), assign the value 1 to column index 15.
#   For rows where the value for the column index 5 is equal to 5 (Newark Airport), assign the value 1 to column index 15.

# create a new column filled with `0`.
